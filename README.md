Here you can find the entire R&D about our topic - Crop Recommendation system for marginalized farmers.

I have uploaded several ipynb file testing different data with different algorithms.

We have a Regressor model ready to run or deploy but the .pkl file is too large(1.4 GB) to upload so we have not yet uploaded it.

It is a prediction model about production of a particular crop based on certain parameters.
